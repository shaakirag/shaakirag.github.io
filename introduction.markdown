I’m Shaakira Gadiwan, and I’m interested in **industrial automation** and the use of computers and robots to create complex machines. I am working towards a career in designing these control systems using my knowledge of **human-machine interfaces** and **programmable logic controllers**.

Passion is a distinguishing feature of mine. It is impossible to accomplish your job well unless you are passionate about it. My **strong desire to help others** by enhancing education has led to my previous success as a **mentor** for high school students from marginalized communities. I’ve learned that helping others succeed motivates me in my learning as well.

My biggest success has been founding the Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers at the University of Calgary. As the first Canadian chapter, it was a challenge to **recruit and mentor members of the executive team**, engage our audience, and create meaningful relationships with industry partners. Through this experience, I developed communication skills, leadership abilities, and fostering a collaborative environment.
