With `ENEL 327`, I expected to learn about a key idea in electrical engineering: signals and how to analyze and process them to evaluate circuits and transfer information using analog signals. Many of my family members have a telecommunications background, which led me to the idea of how signals are employed in wireless networks. I was particularly **intrigued by the concept of digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital conversion** and how it applied to information traveling across the globe. These interests coincide rather well with the course's objectives and content; the final teaching project in Modulation allowed me to examine the principles of signals in an applied setting, which I tied to 5G networks, a contemporary trend in communications. I was surprised to read about the significant differences between 5G and 4G and 4G-LTE in terms of allowable frequencies, cell structure in semiconductor chips, and all the additional infrastructure required to provide considerably quicker and more secure internet.

`ENEL 327` was a course that **combined theory and practice**. There were numerous opportunities for me to improve my `MATLAB` practical abilities by seeing and analyzing signals in the programming platform. This greatly **improved my information retention** since I trained my brain to apply theoretical principles to an experiment-type circumstance every time I learnt something new. I was also using `MATLAB` at work in a signal-related capacity, which fueled my desire to learn the tool. Because I am minoring in computer engineering, the DAC/ADC lab exam piqued my interest because it incorporated many of the computer architectures we studied in Digital Circuits last semester, such as counters and shift registers. This not only refreshed my recollection of the topics, but it also broadened my view on how complex phenomena such as waves can be represented as something as simple as 0s and 1s. This led me to **appreciate the field of computer architecture** even more.

As a result of this experience, I discovered that I am a more **hands-on or visual learner**. I prefer to learn through images rather than textual explanations. The full-page picture, rather than a line-by-line analysis, was tremendously helpful in determining what the system was required to do, especially during the lab exam. I also learned that as an engineer, **communication comes before technical expertise** because it is more necessary to be able to explain the workings of anything to others because many projects may only be completed in groups. When explaining how the ADC converter worked, I found it better to trace the system in the picture rather than trying to make the audience visualize what I was saying. This showed me how to use props and external tools to **improve a presentation**, even if it's just one slide. It is the explainer's responsibility to ensure that the audience understands rather than the other way around, which I have practiced as an engineering student by explaining so many ideas to other students, TAs, and instructors.

Overall, my experience in `ENEL 327` aligned with the course objectives. I benefited from the worksheet sessions in which I used `MATLAB` to reinforce my comprehension of the subjects in the current module. In the future, I realized that I should try to **connect technical principles to real-life situations**. The lab exam, for example, taught me that many electrical engineering ideas may be implemented using computer architecture because that is how many services are consumed â€” via a screen or device. Although I did not incorporate many signal principles into the `ENEL 300` project, I did tie it to topics that interest me, such as telecommunications and computer architecture. As a result, I can **identify more options for future projects** that I may be considering as many practical solutions can be developed using software and hardware. It also made me think about how I may have tackled the project ideas I had at the start of the course that I believed would be too difficult to complete. For future experience in signals and transforms, I believe I have obtained a solid understanding of the mathematical ideas as well as how to apply the concepts to contemporary technological trends.
