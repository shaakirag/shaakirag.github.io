After taking a few entrepreneurship courses, `ENEL 300` provided an opportunity for me to put my knowledge to practice. By analyzing the problem statement given, working within regulatory issues, accounting for sustainability and intellectual property, identifying market needs, and considering commercialization, I was able to **practice the many tenets of entrepreneurship**. The hardest part of this process was understanding if a decision was a correct one. I used my intuition many times and tried my best to make the best use of the facts available. This came into play when I made design decisions that would affect prices, costs, and that relied on market conditions. On the flipside, the most rewarding experience from the entrepreneurship aspect of `ENEL 300` was being able to take an idea and make it real and create value that previously did not exist. Another rewarding experience was the relationships I built with other students in their entrepreneurship journey. Every entrepreneur I know has a story that allowed me to relate to them through common struggles. As a group, we have been through so much, we are willing to support each other at any time. As individuals, we share a common passion to build something from nothing.

Overall, from the entrepreneurship aspect of `ENEL 300`, I learned that my **intuition is a very powerful tool**, and the more I listen to it and use it, the more comfortable I will become with myself. I also recognized and appreciated the **value of building relationships with others** who are on the same journey as me to mentor each other and create better stories and value for our users.
