After switching from online to in-person learning, I has to change my study plan to accommodate for commute time, more fatigue, and to accommodate more time to relax. This meant I had to be effective in the times I did set for myself to study. As I switched to in-person learning then, my task was to plan a better study schedule. To efficiently do this, I started by using odd hours during the day for studying. I find that the scattered one or two hours between classes are easily wasted, and even a short amount of time spent after class to review the material will do as much good for me to develop an understanding and memory of materials than if I did review several days later for more hours. I found that using this method rather than confining myself to a schedule where I would feel pressured to study boosted my motivation to do so. It also helped my mental and physical health as I time for recreation and other activities during other times of the day. The result was that I accomplished more than I thought I would during daylight hours when I am most productive. As well, by starting assignments while my memory of lecture content was still fresh, I was able to easily transfer information from short-term to long-term memory.
