A few practical skills I have developed over the course of my undergraduate degree are analog and digital circuit design, applying linear systems theory and analysis to electrical systems, building computer systems, and data collection and analysis.

As part of my summer research, I also developed skills in Artificial Intelligence using Python and system identification using `MATLAB`. This complements my career goals in industrial automation as I gained experience in control systems and how they can be used to create convenience for a large population.

I believe these practical skills can be used in a broad range of contexts as they all fostered **technical communication, critical thinking, problem solving, and thinking outside the box**.
