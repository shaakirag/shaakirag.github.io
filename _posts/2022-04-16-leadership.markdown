Fig 1: The SASE at UCalgary Team

As the founding member of the first Canadian chapter of the Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers (SASE), I was faced with the task of establishing the foundation for which more Western Canadian universities can build upon. Founding SASE entailed a **high level of responsibility** as I was tasked with drafting regulations and bylaws, recruiting dedicated executive members, planning and hosting social/industry events for undergraduate students, and coordinating with corporate sponsors in Canada and SASE Nationals in the US. I also spoke with students from SASE chapters in the US and how they built the society from ground-up, which helped me **mentor other executive members** to strengthen our chapter. This resulted in the need to **maintain flexibility** to work with people from different backgrounds and in different time zones. The **leadership skills** I gained from founding SASE improves my abilities as a team member and a future engineer. I learned that leadership plays a vital role in the success of the team, as a **good leader can inspire others to strive to achieve their very best**. I also came to appreciate how **communication skills** prove to be very important when speaking among people with different expertise and cultural background, and that proper communication can lead to better decision-making and outcomes. As we move forward with SASE at UCalgary, I hope to continue and grow further by working with students from other Western Canadian universities to help establish more chapters in Canada.
