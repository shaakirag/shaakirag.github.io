This semester I became acquainted with a few learning strategies and experimented with them to develop a method that works best for me. I approached learning strategies as my way of organizing and using my skills to learn and accomplish tasks more effectively and efficiently. The best strategy that I found worked for me is retrieval practice, where I practiced bringing information to my mind without the help of materials. For example, when I was practicing my product pitches, I put all my speaker notes away and drew out a sketch and spoke of my work to my sister. The nature of pitches is that it changes depending on the mood of the audience as to keep them engaged. As such, it is best not to memorize a pitch but speak in “real-time,” or in the moment to adapt to the circumstance. By changing the way in which I stored the information in my head from passive recall to active recall, I was able to quickly answer my sister’s questions for me without referring to my notes and keep her actively engaged during my practice pitch.

I can extend this learning strategy to any academic or non-academic setting. By having the information I need right in front of me, I can not tell if I completely grasp the content to the best of my understanding. Recalling information without supporting materials helps me learn it much more efficiently, whether it be for a test or presentation.
